Training data and Test Data


Training data, also called AI training data, training set, training dataset, or learning set — is the information used to train an algorithm. The training data includes both input data and the corresponding expected output. Based on this “ground truth” data, the algorithm can learn how to apply technologies such as neural networks, to learn and produce complex results, so that it can make accurate decisions when later presented with new data. Training data can be used for various machine learning algorithms, such as sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and chatbot training.

Testing data, on the other hand, includes only input data, not the corresponding expected output. The testing data is used to assess how well your algorithm was trained, and to estimate model properties.


Validation Set: 

This is crucial to choose the right parameters for your estimator. We can divide the training set into train set and validation set. Based on the validation test results, the model can be trained(for instance, changing parameters, classifiers). This will help us get the most optimized model.
